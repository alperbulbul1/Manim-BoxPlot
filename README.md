## **Seaborn-Style Box Plot Visualization with Manim**

This Manim script is designed to create an animated visualization of seaborn-style box plots. It's an excellent tool for educators, data scientists, and anyone interested in animated data presentations. The script takes statistical data across various categories and represents it through box plots and individual data points, showcasing distributions and variances in a visually engaging manner.

### **Features**

- **Multiple Categories Visualization**: Supports visualization of data across several categories. Ideal for comparative analysis.
- **Statistical Insights**: Each box plot represents key statistical measures: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
- **Individual Data Points**: Alongside the box plots, individual data points are plotted, providing a more detailed view of the data distribution.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Easy to customize data, colors, and labels for different data sets within the script.
- **Animated Plotting**: Leveraging Manim's capabilities, the script animates the drawing of plots, making the presentation more engaging.

### **Usage**

1. **Data Setup**: Modify the **`categories`**, **`subcat1_data`**, and **`subcat2_data`** variables with your data. Ensure that each category in **`categories`** has corresponding data in **`subcat1_data`** and **`subcat2_data`**.
2. **Configuration**: Set the **`box_width`**, **`spacing`**, and **`group_spacing`** variables to adjust the layout of the box plots.
3. **Running the Script**: Execute the script with Manim to generate the animation. The script creates a video file showcasing the animated box plots.

### **Requirements**

- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/): Ensure you have Manim installed and configured to run scripts.

### **Example Visualization**

The script generates an animated sequence where box plots and individual data points for each category are sequentially drawn on the axes. Categories are labeled, and each plot is color-coded for distinction.
